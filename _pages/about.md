I am working in the [PreMeDICaL Inria-Inserm team](https://team.inria.fr/premedical/) as a postdoc with [Julie Josse](https://juliejosse.com/). Previously I completed my PhD at ETH Zurich under the supervision of [Nicolai Meinshausen](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~nicolai/) and [Peter BÃ¼hlmann](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~buhlmann/). I had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of different problems in the past, ranging from applications in Marketing Research and Finance to pure Statistics. Currently, I am interested in Distributional Prediction, Missing Values and Robust Estimation. 



News:
=============
* Our paper developing asymptotically valid uncertainty quantification for Distributional Random Forests (DRF) just got published in the [Journal of Machine Learning Research](https://jmlr.org/papers/v24/23-0185.html).
* Our CLVTools package implementing a wide range of models for Customer Lifetime modelling, just received a major update. In particular, the flagship extended Pareto/NBD model is now coded in Rcpp!
