I am an Assistant Professor in Statistics and Business Analytics at the Geneva School of Economics and Management ([GSEM](https://www.unige.ch/gsem/en/)), working on Distributional Prediction, Missing Values and Robust Estimation. Previously, I was a postdoc in the [PreMeDICaL Inria-Inserm team](https://team.inria.fr/premedical/) with [Julie Josse](https://juliejosse.com/). I completed my PhD at ETH Zurich under the supervision of [Nicolai Meinshausen](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~nicolai/) and [Peter BÃ¼hlmann](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~buhlmann/). During this time, I had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of different problems, ranging from statistics and machine learning to applications in Marketing Research and Finance. An overview of my research can be found [here](/files/Research_Overview.pdf).

News:
=============
* Our paper "Parametric MMD Estimation with Missing Values: Robustness to Missingness and Data Model Misspecification" is now available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00448). We propose a novel M-estimation procedure based on the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), which is provably robust to both model misspecification and deviations from the assumed missingness mechanism. This a very exciting new methodology that I hope will find lots of applications!   
* Our paper "PKLM: A Flexible MCAR Test Using Classification" got published in [Psychometrika](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychometrika/article/pklm-a-flexible-mcar-test-using-classification/68F862DF2B90A57D4A2830E486D36C23).
* Our paper developing the Causal Distributional Random Forest to estimate distributional treatment effects with asymptotically valid uncertainty quantification is on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08778).
* Our paper "What Is a Good Imputation Under MAR Missingness" providing a comprehensive analysis of imputation under MAR, including an identifability result, recommondations and ways to evaluate imputation methods, is now available on [HAL](https://hal.science/hal-04521894). In addition, comprehensive slides and an R Example can be found [here](/files/Final.zip).
