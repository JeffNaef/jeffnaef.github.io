For two fall semesters in 2017 and 2018 I taught the graduate course "Fundamental Probability for Finance" at University of Zurich. This was a 9 ECTS credit course with 4 hours per week, with the aim of introducing probability theory to students in Finance. I had the opportunity to design it from the ground up, losely based on previous slides. The script for the course is available [here](/files/Script.pdf)
